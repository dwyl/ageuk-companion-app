The companion app is an application to help guide a conversation between a
companion and a client (elderly person). The ultimate goal of the app is to
provide a list of actions to be completed after the conversation that will
improve the life of the elderly person.

### About AgeUK

AgeUK is the UK's largest charity working with older people. Some of the key
areas AgeUK are involved in include:

+ Care and Support for health and wellbeing
+ Computers and technology for the elderly
+ Support with finances
+ Support with housing
+ A companion service
+ Campaigns to raise awareness of difficult situations faced by elderly people
+ Research focused exclusively on later life

### The problem

AgeUK currently operates 150 independent sites across the country. Each of these
sites offers a companion service where a companion will go to an elderly
person's home, have a free flowing conversation with them and try to figure out
if there is anything AgeUK can do to help improve their quality of life.

Because these local AgeUK services run independently and may have different
services available in the local area, there can be differences in the topics
which are covered in these conversations.

### The solution

The companion app tries to solve this problem by acting as a guide for the
conversation and informing feedback on the needs of elderly people in
different areas. It can also provide a list of actions to be completed.
